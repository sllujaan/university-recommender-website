                Applicants must meet the minimum eligibility criteria in order to be considered for admission to the Undergraduate Programme. Meeting this criteria does not guarantee admission to the Undergraduate Programme. Students are selected for admission to LUMS Undergraduate Programmes based on the following factors:

                Academic Background
                Performance in the Admission Test
                Completed and submitted application form and supporting documents by the stipulated deadline
                Application Review
                Interview (if called)
                
                
                LUMS is committed to admitting the best academic students who have the potential to contribute to the learning environment at the University and bring change to their communities. Consequently, LUMS considers academic achievements alongside other aspects of a candidate’s application.
                
                Each successful applicant is made an offer for entry into a particular School at LUMS. Applicants for each School are selected on the basis of Programme requirements of that particular School. Applicants should carefully choose the School(s) they apply to, and take into consideration their interests, motivations, academic strengths, and future career paths.
                
                Admission in a specific school is based on merit and the availability of seats. Decisions on the admission of applicants are final.

                The above breakdown of fee structure is for Year 1 of the 4 Year BSc (Honours) Economics and Mathematics (Joint Major) programme.
Fees are payable by semester according to the schedule given in the Annual Fee bill.
Through an amendment in the Income Tax Ordinance 2001 by Finance Act 2013, advance tax (under section 236 I) shall be collected @ 5% on the entire amount of fee (if Student Payable exceeds PKR 200,000 per annum excluding the amount refundable).
Advance tax paid on fee is adjustable at the time of filing of Income tax return. LUMS will issue Advance Tax Certificate in this regard at year-end.
University fees are usually announced once each year, for the following academic year. However, tuition and fees are subject to change without notice.
